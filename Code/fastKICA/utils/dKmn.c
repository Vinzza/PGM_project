  dK = dKmn(Knm, inds, w, T, sigma)
  Knm: n x d kernel submatrix, the result is the derivative of this matrix
  inds: indices from incomplete Cholesky decomposition
  K is constructed on wT (row vector w of demixing matrix), nonsparse
  T is original data
  sigma: kernel width

  computes dvec(Knm)/dw

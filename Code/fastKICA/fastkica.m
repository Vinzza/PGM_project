% INPUT:
% MS:       mixed signals, m x n (m sources, n samples)
% Xin:      initial demixing matrix: Xin' * MS are estimated sources
%           (initial guess)
% maxiter:  maximum number of iterations
% sigma:    width of Gaussian kernel
% thresh:   convergence threshold: stops if difference in subsequent values
%           of HSIC is less than thresh
%
% OUTPUT:
% X:        demixing matrix: X' * MX are estimated sources
% XS:       sequence of X for each iteration
% hsics:    HSIC at each iteration
%
% The algorithm terminates if either the difference in hsic values is less
% than 'thresh' or the maximum number of iterations (maxiter) is reached.

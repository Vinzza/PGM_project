\begin{block}{Problem statement}
Let $x\in\zR^p$ be some random variables whose components correspond to different mix of some primitive sources $s_i\in\zR^n$. The aim is to retrieve an estimation $y$ of every source $s_i$, given only $x$. We note $A$ the mixing matrix and $W$ the separation matrix such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{pb}
 x = A s \ \ \mbox{and} \ \ y = W x.
\end{equation}

We suppose that:\begin{itemize}
\item \ the sources are independents
\item \ the mix is linear and instantaneous
\item \ at most one source has a Gaussian distribution.  
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

%% --------- ---- -  -        SEPARATION DE BLOCS         -  - ---- --------- %%

\begin{block}{Measure of independance}
We want to find $W$ that maximises the independence of $y=Wx$. The mutual information, defined in~\ref{mutinf} is theoretically the best measure of independence:
\begin{equation}
\label{mutinf}
\zZ IY = \int_{\zR^p} P(Y) \log\frac{P(Y)}{\prod_i P_i(Y_i)} \zdx Y,
\end{equation}
but the information theory gives us other quantity to work with.

(... parler de la gaussianité/correlation/... ...)

We can show that:
\begin{equation}
\label{pyt}
        \zZ IY + \sum_i\zZ G{Y_i} = \zZ GY + \zZ CY.
\end{equation}

  \caption{This figure illustrates equation~\ref{pyt}. !!!Vince explique un peu les axes etc.!!!}
\end{figure}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Algorithms}
Several algorithms have been developed to perform ICA, among those we can cite:
\begin{itemize}
		\item HJ
		\item JADE
		\item FastICA
		\item KernelICA
\end{itemize}

%One way to compare these algorithms is by their estimated mixing (ou unmixig) matrices : given numerous generated i.i.d. sources and a mixing matrix, all of these algorithms will return the best estimated mixing matrix according to their corresponding method.
%Thus we could compare the estimations with our original mixing matrix with any norm whatsoever, but as we previously said, the algorithms are not able to find out the original order of the sources or their amplitude.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Performance evaluation}
One way to evaluate the performance of an ICA algorithm is to look at the estimated mixing matrix. However, the solution couple $(A,s)$of equation~\ref{pb} is only defined up to a scaling factor and a permutation of the components. The ''Amari distance'' (which is not an actual distance), gives a criterion of proximity between two matrices regardless to these two issues and is then a convenient metrics to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.
If $U$ and $V$ are two $n$-by-$n$ matrices, the Amari distance is defined by:
\begin{equation}
	d(U,V) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n|a_{ij}|}{\max_j |a_{ij}|}-1 \right)+\frac{1}{2n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^n \left(\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n|a_{ij}|}{\max_i |a_{ij}|}-1 \right)
\end{equation}
with $a_{ij} = (UV^{-1})_{ij}$. The closest it is to 0, the more $U$ and $V$ represent the same components.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Kernel ICA}
	The idea here is to have a contrast function defined by the correlation of a range of functions over a function vector space $\mathcal{F}$. Thus defining the $\mathcal{F}$-correlation :
	\begin{equation*}
		\rho_{\mathcal{F}} (x_1,x_2) = \max\limits_{f_1,f_2 \in \mathcal{F}} \text{corr}(f_1(x_1),f_2(x_2))
	\end{equation*}
For $\mathcal{F}$ ``large enough'', we have the following equivalence : $\rho_{\mathcal{F}} (x_1,x_2) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x_1 \ \& \ x_2$ are independent, hence the ``vector space contrast function'' idea.
	We then use the \textit{reproducing kernel Hilbert space} to obtain tractable computations over the vector space $\mathcal{F}$.

\begin{block}{Modus operandi}
We will thereby analyze the results of the algorithms in terms of Amari distance over large number of i.i.d generated sources from several different distributions.
